# Umigon-lexicons
Includes lexicons with Boolean conditions and conditional expressions, and procedures to evaluate those. These are the fundamental blocks underpinning applications in sentiment analysis, emotion identification and more.

## Where are the lexicons?

The static text files for the lexicons have moved in a separate repo, to facilitate testing. The repo you are presently visiting includes the code logic to handle these lexicons, and in particular the rules to make decisions based on them.

## Try it

These lexicons are implemented in a click-and-point, free, registration-free [web application](https://nocodefunctions.com).

## Multilingual

* English, French and Spanish are covered and new languages will be added.
